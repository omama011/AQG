# AQG
Automatic question generation (QG) is the task of preparing relevant questions from a context 
or a paragraph .It can be used to generate assessment questions to test the learning of a 
particular topic or lesson.We explore the performance of diverse approaches for 
QG utilizing the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) as the benchmark. The 
methodology encompasses transformer architectures for question generation on SQUAD 
dataset.
